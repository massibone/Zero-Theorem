# Zero-Theorem

The Rational Zeros Theorem states: 
If P(x) is a polynomial with integer coefficients and if is a zero of P(x) (P( ) = 0), 
then p is a factor of the constant term of P(x) and q is a factor of the leading coefficient of P(x). 
We can use the Rational Zeros Theorem to find all the rational zeros of a polynomial.
